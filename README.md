# Open Company Database (5M companies, 2026): findings, method and data card

*Fliar Research · released October 2026 · licence CC BY-NC 4.0*

**How this dataset was acquired.** Every row comes from the [Radar API](https://github.com/fliarbi/radar-api-mcp), Fliar's company-data API and MCP server. Radar builds
its company database by merging public company registries, company websites, business news and job postings into one record per company,
keyed by the company's website domain. Each record is classified into a sector, industry and business model by Radar's own models and
carries headquarters location, founding year, funding status and size. This release keeps the firmographic core of the five million
companies that have both a name and a website: one row per domain, with country names normalised and founding years checked. The full
records, with financials, funding, people and technology, are available through `POST /v1/companies/profile`
([reference](https://github.com/fliarbi/radar-api-mcp/blob/main/docs/reference/get_company.md)) or the `get_company` MCP tool.

> **This file is a 2% sample: 100,000 of 4,863,273 companies.** It keeps every record for a fixed subset of domains.
> The subset is chosen by a hash, so it stays the same from one release to the next. The findings and tables below were computed
> on the **full** data. For the rest, the withheld fields and monthly updates, [get a Radar API key](https://fliarbi.com/radar-api/developer) ([docs](https://github.com/fliarbi/radar-api-mcp)).
> Each row's `fliar_profile_url` opens the company's full profile on Fliar.

## Method

1. **Scope.** Every company in Radar's database with a name and a website, as of October 2026.
2. **One row per domain.** Domains are lowercased with the scheme, `www.` and any path removed. When several records share a domain, the most complete one (founding year, sector, country, city, status, size) is kept.
3. **Country.** Country names are normalised (for example "england, united kingdom", "uk" and "dubai united arab emirates" become "United Kingdom" / "United Arab Emirates"). Values that are not a country, such as state names or codes, are blank.
4. **Founding year.** Years before 1800 or after 2026 are blank.
5. **Labels.** Sector is the first practice area and industry the first listed industry; business model keeps up to three tags. Status "Closed" is a company recorded as shut down.
6. **Removed.** Companies whose name or domain names a data provider, and names containing a phone number, are dropped. No revenue, funding amounts, investors, people, contacts, descriptions or technology fields are published.

7. **Sample.** Each domain key is ranked by `sha1(key)`. Keys are taken in rank order until the file holds max(25%, 5,000) rows (capped at 100,000).

8. **Profile links.** Links are built from Fliar's company index and checked against it. A row whose company has no public profile has an empty link.

## Limitations

- The database leans toward companies with an online presence and toward English-speaking markets; it is not a census of all firms.
- Country is unknown for about a third of companies, and city for a larger share; they are blank, not guessed.
- Status and funding flags are only as current as the last update of each record; "Unfunded" means no funding is recorded.
- Recent founding years are under-counted, because new companies enter the database with a lag.
- Employee bands are available for about one company in five.
- This file is a 2% sample (capped at 100,000 rows); the tables above use all five million companies.
